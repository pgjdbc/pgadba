/**
 * A mutable object that controls whether a transactionEnd Operation sends
 * a database commit or a database rollback to the server. A transactionEnd
 * Operation is created with a Transaction. By default a transactionEnd
 * Operation requests that the database end the transaction with a commit.
 * If Transaction#setRollbackOnly is called on the Transaction used to create
 * the Operation prior to the Operation being executed, the Operation will
 * request that the database end the transaction with a rollback.
 * 
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *   Transaction t = conn.transaction();
 *   conn.countOperation(updateSql)
 *       .resultProcessor( count -> { if (count > 1) t.setRollbackOnly(); } )
 *       .submit();
 *   conn.commit(t);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * A Transaction can not be used to create more than one endTransaction 
 * Operation.
 * 
 * A Transaction is thread safe.
