/**
 * <p>
 * A set of {@link Operation}s that share certain properties, are managed as a
 * unit, and are executed as a unit. The {@link Operation}s created by an
 * {@link OperationGroup} and submitted are the member {@link Operation}s of
 * that {@link OperationGroup}. An {@link OperationGroup} is not a transaction
 * and is not related to a transaction in any way.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An {@link OperationGroup} conceptually has a collection of member
 * {@link Operation}s. When an {@link OperationGroup} is submitted it is placed
 * in the collection of the {@link OperationGroup} of which it is a member. The
 * member {@link OperationGroup} is executed according to the attributes of the
 * {@link OperationGroup} of which it is a member. The member {@link Operation}s
 * of an {@link OperationGroup} are executed according to the attributes of that
 * {@link OperationGroup}.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * How an {@link OperationGroup} is executed depends on its attributes.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an {@link OperationGroup} has a condition and the value of that condition
 * is {@link Boolean#TRUE} then execute the member {@link Operation}s as below.
 * If it is {@link Boolean#FALSE} then the {@link OperationGroup} is completed
 * with the value null. If the condition completed exceptionally then the
 * {@link OperationGroup} is completed exceptionally with a
 * {@link SqlSkippedException} that has that exception as its cause.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If the {@link OperationGroup} is sequential the member {@link Operation}s are
 * executed in the order they were submitted. If it is parallel, they may be
 * executed in any order including simultaneously.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an {@link OperationGroup} is dependent and a member {@link Operation}
 * completes exceptionally the remaining member {@link Operation}s in the
 * collection are completed exceptionally with a {@link SqlSkippedException}
 * that has the initial {@link Exception} as its cause and the {@link OperationGroup}
 * is completed exceptionally with the initial {@link Exception}. A member
 * {@link Operation} in-flight may either complete normally or be completed
 * exceptionally but must complete one way or the other. [NOTE: Too strong?]</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * After a call to {@link OperationGroup#submitHoldingForMoreMembers} the
 * {@link OperationGroup} is submitted and held. After a call to 
 * {@link OperationGroup#releaseProhibitingMoreMembers} the {@link OperationGroup} 
 * is no longer held and is still submitted. Holding permits member {@link Operation}s
 * to be executed at the same time additional member {@link Operation}s are
 * submitted. Collecting the member {@link Operation}s' results does not begin
 * until the {@link OperationGroup} is no longer held.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If an {@link OperationGroup} is held additional member {@link Operation}s may
 * be submitted. If an {@link OperationGroup} is not held, no additional member 
 * {@link Operation}s  may be submitted after the {@link OperationGroup} is 
 * submitted. If an {@link OperationGroup} is held it will be completed only after 
 * it is released or if conditional and the condition is not {@link Boolean#TRUE}. 
 * If a {@link OperationGroup} is dependent, held, one of its member
 * {@link Operation}s completed exceptionally, and its queue is empty then the
 * {@link OperationGroup} is released.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The result of this {@link OperationGroup} is the result of collecting the
 * results of its member {@link Operation}s. If the {@link OperationGroup} is 
 * dependent and one of its member {@link Operation}s completes exceptionally,
 * the {@link OperationGroup} is completed exceptionally.</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this class must be thread safe as result and error
 * handlers running asynchronously may be accessing an {@link OperationGroup} in
 * parallel with each other and with a user thread.</p>

* <p>
 * ISSUE: Currently no way to create a nested {@link OperationGroup}. That is an
 * intentional limitation but may be a simplification we can live with. Or not.</p>
 *
 * @param <S> The type of the result of the member {@link Operation}s
