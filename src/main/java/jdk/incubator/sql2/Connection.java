/**
 * A {@link Connection} is an abstraction of a connection to a SQL database and
 * a group of {@link Operation}s to be executed by that SQL database. No method
 * on {@link Connection} or any of its dependent objects ({@link RowOperation}
 * etc) blocks with the exception of those few methods with "Wait" in their
 * name. Any other method that might block must execute any potentially blocking
 * action in a thread other than the calling thread.

* <p>
 * All methods inherited from OperationGroup throw IllegalStateException if the
 * the connection is not active.</p>

* <p>
 * An implementation of this type must be thread safe as result and error
 * handlers running asynchronously may be accessing a {@link Connection} in
 * parallel with each other and with a user thread. {@link Connection}s are not
 * required to support multiplexed use; a single {@link Connection} should be
 * used for only one unit of work at a time. Executing independent units of work
 * on a single {@link Connection} in parallel will most likely lead to
 * unpredictable outcomes. As a rule of thumb only one user thread should access
 * a {@link Connection} at a time. Such a user thread should execute a complete
 * unit of work before another user thread accesses the {@link Connection}. An
 * implementation may support parallel multiplexed use, but it is not required.</p>
